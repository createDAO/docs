This guide will walk you through the essential prerequisites and the basic steps to launch your first DAO using the CreateDAO.org platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1.  **A Web3 Wallet:** You'll need a browser extension wallet compatible with EVM blockchains (like MetaMask, Rabby, Coinbase Wallet, etc.). This wallet will be used to connect to the platform and sign transactions for deploying your DAO.
2.  **Network Funds:** Ensure your wallet has sufficient native currency (e.g., ETH on Ethereum, MATIC on Polygon) on the specific blockchain network where you intend to deploy your DAO. These funds are required to pay for the gas fees associated with the deployment transactions.
3.  **Basic Blockchain Understanding:** Familiarity with concepts like blockchain networks, gas fees, and wallet interactions is helpful.

## Quick Start: Creating Your DAO via CreateDAO.org

The CreateDAO.org interface provides the simplest way to launch your DAO. Here’s a high-level overview of the process:

1.  **Visit CreateDAO.org:** Navigate to the official website in your browser.
2.  **Connect Your Wallet:** Use the "Connect Wallet" button to link your Web3 wallet to the platform. Ensure you select the correct network where you want to deploy.
3.  **Configure Your DAO:** Fill out the DAO creation form. This typically includes:
    *   **DAO Name:** The name of your organization.
    *   **Token Name:** The name for your DAO's governance token.
    *   **Token Symbol:** A short ticker symbol for your token (e.g., MYDAO).
    *   **Initial Token Supply:** The total amount of tokens to be created initially. *Note: A portion might be allocated to the creator, with the rest going to the DAO Treasury.*
    *   *(Optional)* Advanced settings might include initial governance parameters like voting periods or quorum requirements (though these are often set to sensible defaults initially and can be changed later via governance).
4.  **Review and Deploy:** Carefully review all the configuration details. Once satisfied, initiate the deployment process. Your wallet will prompt you to confirm several transactions (for deploying the factory, token, treasury, staking, and DAO contracts). Approve each transaction.
5.  **Deployment Confirmation:** Wait for the transactions to be confirmed on the blockchain. The interface will usually provide feedback on the progress and confirm once your DAO is successfully deployed. You'll typically receive the addresses of your newly created DAO contract and its associated modules (Token, Treasury, Staking).

Congratulations! You have successfully launched your DAO using CreateDAO. You can now proceed to manage it, potentially using a compatible DAO management platform or by interacting directly with the contracts.
