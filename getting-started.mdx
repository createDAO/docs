# Getting Started

Welcome to CreateDAO v2! This guide will help you understand the basics and get you ready to create your first DAO.

## What You'll Need

Before creating a DAO, make sure you have:

1. **A Web3 Wallet**
   - MetaMask (recommended)
   - Coinbase Wallet
   - WalletConnect-compatible wallets
   - Any EVM-compatible wallet

2. **Cryptocurrency for Gas Fees**
   - **Base Mainnet**: ~0.002-0.005 ETH
   - **Sepolia Testnet**: Free SepoliaETH from [faucets](https://sepoliafaucet.com)

3. **Basic Understanding**
   - What a DAO is
   - How blockchain transactions work
   - Gas fees and wallet confirmation

<Tip>
**First time?** We recommend starting on Sepolia testnet to familiarize yourself with the process before deploying to mainnet.

## Quick Overview: What is CreateDAO v2?

CreateDAO v2 is a platform for deploying complete DAO governance systems using **OpenZeppelin Governor** - the industry-standard framework for on-chain governance.

### What You Get

When you create a DAO, you deploy three smart contracts in one transaction:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="DAOToken" icon="coins">
    ERC20 governance token with automatic voting power activation
  </Card>
  <Card title="DAOGovernor" icon="users">
    Proposal and voting system with OpenZeppelin extensions
  </Card>
  <Card title="TimelockController" icon="vault">
    Secure treasury holding 99% of tokens with 1-day execution delay
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Key Features

**Auto-Delegation**
- No manual delegation required
- Voting power activates automatically when you receive tokens
- Ready to vote immediately

**Secure Treasury**
- 99% of tokens held in timelock
- All treasury actions require governance approval
- 1-day delay before execution for security

**Manager Role**
- On-chain authorization for DAO management
- Changeable only through governance
- Designed for integration with platforms like OpenBook

**Gas Efficient**
- Uses EIP-1167 minimal proxies (clones)
- Token and Governor proxies are only 45 bytes each
- ~69% gas savings vs traditional deployment

## Understanding the Architecture

```
Your DAO = Token + Governor + Treasury
```

### 1. DAOToken (ERC20Votes)

Your governance token gives holders voting power:
- **Standard**: ERC20 with 18 decimals
- **Voting Power**: Built-in checkpoint system
- **Auto-Delegation**: Automatically activates when tokens are received
- **Distribution**: 1% to creator, 99% to treasury

### 2. DAOGovernor (OpenZeppelin Governor)

The governance contract manages your DAO:
- **Proposals**: Any token holder with 1%+ can propose
- **Voting**: FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN
- **Quorum**: Minimum 1% participation required
- **Extensions**: Includes all standard OZ Governor features
- **Manager Role**: Special address for off-chain authorization

### 3. TimelockController (Treasury)

The secure treasury holds DAO assets:
- **Holds**: 99% of token supply
- **Delay**: 1 day between proposal passing and execution
- **Security**: Prevents rushed or malicious actions
- **Control**: Only governance can move funds

---

## The Governance Process

### Creating a Proposal

1. You need **1% of token supply** to propose
2. Proposal includes: target contracts, values, calldata, and description
3. Voting delay starts (default: 1 day)

### Voting Period

1. After delay, voting opens for a set period (default: 1 week)
2. Token holders cast votes: FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN
3. Voting power = token balance at proposal creation time

### Execution

1. If quorum met (1%+) and majority votes FOR, proposal succeeds
2. Proposal is queued in the timelock
3. After 1-day delay, anyone can execute
4. Actions are executed on-chain

## Common Use Cases

### Community Organization

Perfect for:
- Online communities wanting shared decision-making
- Content creator DAOs
- Gaming guilds
- Social clubs going on-chain

### Business Operations

Ideal for:
- RWA (Real World Asset) management
- Transparent business operations
- Multi-stakeholder companies
- Service cooperatives

**Integration**: Use with [OpenBook](https://openbook.so) for full ERP/CRM/POS with radical transparency.

### Investment Groups

Great for:
- Collective investment decisions
- Treasury management
- Fund allocation
- Grant programs

---

## Token Distribution Strategy

When you create a DAO:
- **You get 1%** - Enough to meet quorum and create initial proposals
- **Treasury gets 99%** - Distributed through governance

### Why 1%?

The 1% allocation is carefully chosen because:
- OpenZeppelin Governor requires minimum 1% quorum
- You need exactly 1% to bootstrap governance
- After setup, you can propose distributing tokens to members

### Distributing to Members

After creating your DAO, create proposals to:
1. Transfer tokens from treasury to founding members
2. Set up vesting schedules (via custom contracts)
3. Reward contributors
4. Build your community

## Governance Parameters

You'll choose these when creating your DAO:

| Parameter | Recommended | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Voting Delay** | 1 day | Time before voting starts |
| **Voting Period** | 1 week | How long voting lasts |
| **Quorum** | 1% (fixed) | Minimum participation |
| **Proposal Threshold** | 1% (fixed) | Tokens needed to propose |
| **Timelock Delay** | 1 day (fixed) | Security delay before execution |

<Note>
Voting Delay and Voting Period can be customized during creation. Other parameters are set to optimal defaults and can be changed later through governance.
