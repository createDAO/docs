## What is CreateDAO?

CreateDAO is an open-source platform designed to simplify the creation and deployment of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) across multiple blockchain networks. It provides a standardized, secure, and upgradeable set of smart contracts based on industry best practices, coupled with user-friendly interfaces to make DAO creation accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical expertise.

The core of CreateDAO is a factory contract system that allows users to deploy a suite of essential DAO components, including:
*   A Governance Token (ERC20-based)
*   A Staking Contract for voting power
*   A Treasury Contract to manage funds
*   The main DAO contract orchestrating governance (proposals and execution)

Optional modules, like Presale contracts, can be added later through the DAO's own governance process.

## Vision and Goals

Our vision is to empower communities and organizations to self-govern effectively and transparently using blockchain technology. We aim to lower the barrier to entry for DAO creation by providing:

*   **Simplicity:** An intuitive process for launching a fully functional DAO.
*   **Security:** Audited and battle-tested smart contract patterns.
*   **Flexibility:** Support for multiple blockchains and upgradeable contracts.
*   **Accessibility:** Open-source code and free-to-use tools.
*   **Interoperability:** Standardized contracts that can integrate with other platforms (like DAO management tools).

Our goal is to become the go-to foundational layer for DAO creation, fostering innovation and decentralization across the web3 ecosystem.

## Key Features

*   **Multi-Chain Deployment:** Launch your DAO on various supported EVM-compatible blockchains.
*   **Standardized & Upgradeable Contracts:** Utilizes the UUPS proxy pattern for seamless upgrades via DAO governance.
*   **Core Modules Included:** Token, Staking, Treasury, and Governance logic deployed together.
*   **Optional Modules:** Extend DAO functionality (e.g., Presale) through proposals.
*   **Gas Efficient:** Optimized contracts to minimize deployment and interaction costs.
*   **Open Source:** All code is publicly available under a Business Source License (BUSL-1.1), transitioning to a more permissive license over time.
*   **User Interface:** A web application (CreateDAO.org) provides a guided experience for DAO creation.

## Who is this Documentation For?

This documentation is intended for a wide audience, including:

*   **Community Leaders & Founders:** Individuals looking to launch a DAO for their project or community.
*   **Developers:** Those who want to understand the underlying smart contracts, integrate with CreateDAO, or build applications on top of it (like DAO management platforms).
*   **DAO Members:** Participants who want to learn how their CreateDAO-based organization functions, including governance processes.
*   **Anyone interested in DAOs:** Individuals curious about DAO architecture and the CreateDAO implementation.

Whether you're deploying your first DAO or are an experienced developer, these docs aim to provide the information you need.
