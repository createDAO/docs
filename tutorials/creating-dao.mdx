# Creating a DAO

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) using CreateDAO v2. By the end, you'll have deployed a fully functional DAO with:
- **Governance token** with automatic voting power
- **Governor contract** for proposals and voting
- **Secure treasury** with timelock protection

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Web3 wallet (like MetaMask) installed and set up
- Cryptocurrency in your wallet for gas fees (ETH on Base/Sepolia)
- Basic understanding of blockchain and DAO concepts

## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1. Go to [CreateDAO.org](https://createdao.org)
2. Click on the **"Create DAO"** button
3. Click **"Connect Wallet"** in the top-right corner
4. Select your wallet provider (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, etc.)
5. Approve the connection request in your wallet

<Note>
Your wallet address will become the initial **Manager** of the DAO and receive 1% of the tokens to bootstrap governance.
</Note>

## Step 2: Select a Network

1. Choose the blockchain network where you want to deploy your DAO:
   - **Base** (Mainnet) - For production DAOs
   - **Sepolia** (Testnet) - For testing (recommended first)

2. If you're not already connected to that network, your wallet will prompt you to switch
3. Confirm the network switch in your wallet

<Tip>
**Testing First?** We strongly recommend deploying on Sepolia testnet first to familiarize yourself with the process. You can get free Sepolia ETH from faucets like [sepoliafaucet.com](https://sepoliafaucet.com).
</Tip>

## Step 3: Enter DAO Details

Fill in the following information for your DAO:

### Basic Information

**DAO Name**
- The name of your organization (e.g., "Community Coffee DAO")
- This will be displayed in governance interfaces

**Token Name**
- The full name of your governance token (e.g., "Community Coffee Token")

**Token Symbol**
- A short symbol for your token, 2-6 characters (e.g., "CCT")
- Will be displayed in wallets and explorers

**Total Supply**
- The total number of tokens to create (e.g., "1000000" for 1 million tokens)
- Entered as whole numbers - the system automatically handles the 18 decimals
- **Distribution**: 1% goes to you (the creator), 99% to the DAO treasury

<Warning>
**Total supply is permanent!** Once created, the total supply cannot be increased. Choose carefully based on your community size and tokenomics needs.
</Warning>

### Governance Parameters

**Voting Delay**
- Time before voting starts after a proposal is created
- Recommended: **1 day** (86400 seconds)
- Gives members time to review proposals before voting begins

**Voting Period**
- How long members can vote on a proposal
- Recommended: **1 week** (604800 seconds)
- Balances urgency with member participation

<Info>
All governance parameters can be changed later through governance proposals if your DAO decides to adjust them.
</Info>

## Step 4: Review and Deploy

1. **Review** all the information you've entered
2. **Estimated costs** will be displayed:
   - Gas fee: ~0.002-0.005 ETH on Base
   - No protocol fees - CreateDAO is free to use!

3. Click the **"Create DAO"** button
4. Your wallet will prompt you to confirm the transaction
5. **Review the gas fee** and confirm

<Note>
Creating a DAO deploys three smart contracts (Token, Governor, Treasury) in a single transaction using gas-efficient proxies.
</Note>

## Step 5: Wait for Deployment

1. The deployment process will begin
2. You'll see a progress indicator
3. Typical deployment time: **30-90 seconds** depending on network conditions
4. **Do not close** the browser window during deployment

## Step 6: Save Your DAO Information

Once deployment is complete, you'll see a success message with important information:

### Contract Addresses

- **Token Address**: Your governance token (ERC20)
- **Governor Address**: Your governance contract
- **Timelock Address**: Your treasury contract

### What to Save

1. **Copy all three addresses** and store them securely
2. **Bookmark the governance page** for easy access
3. **Note your token symbol** for finding it in wallets

<Warning>
**Important!** Save these addresses immediately. While they're recorded on the blockchain, having them handy makes managing your DAO much easier.
</Warning>

## Step 7: Verify Your DAO

### Check Your Wallet

1. Open your wallet (MetaMask, etc.)
2. You should see **1% of your total supply** in your wallet
3. Your tokens are **automatically delegated** - ready to vote immediately!

### View on Block Explorer

1. Click the explorer links to view your contracts
2. Verify the token name and symbol are correct
3. Check that 99% of tokens are in the Timelock (treasury)

## Understanding Your DAO

### Token Distribution

- **You (Creator)**: 1% of total supply
  - Enables you to meet quorum (1% minimum)
  - Allows you to create and pass initial proposals
  - Already delegated - voting power is active

- **Treasury (Timelock)**: 99% of total supply
  - Held securely in the TimelockController
  - Can only be moved through governance proposals
  - 1-day execution delay for security

### Governance Process

1. **Create Proposal**: Requires 1% of tokens (you qualify!)
2. **Voting Delay**: Proposal enters voting after your set delay
3. **Active Voting**: Members vote FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN
4. **Quorum Check**: Needs 1% participation minimum
5. **Timelock Queue**: Passed proposals wait 1 day
6. **Execution**: Anyone can execute after delay

### Manager Role

- **You are the Manager**: Your wallet address is set as the initial manager
- **Purpose**: On-chain authorization for DAO management platforms
- **Changing Manager**: Only through governance proposals
- **Use Case**: Integration with tools like [OpenBook](https://openbook.so) for transparent business operations

## Next Steps

### Distribute Tokens to Members

Create your first proposal to distribute tokens:

```javascript
// Example: Transfer 10,000 tokens from treasury
const token = await ethers.getContractAt("DAOToken", TOKEN_ADDRESS);
const governor = await ethers.getContractAt("DAOGovernor", GOVERNOR_ADDRESS);

// Encode the transfer call
const transferCalldata = token.interface.encodeFunctionData('transfer', [
  recipientAddress,
  ethers.parseEther("10000")
]);

// Create proposal
await governor.propose(
  [TOKEN_ADDRESS],           // targets
  [0],                       // values (no ETH)
  [transferCalldata],        // calldatas
  "Proposal #1: Distribute tokens to founding team members"
);
```

### Manage Your DAO

Visit these platforms to manage your DAO:

- **[Tally](https://tally.xyz)**: Create proposals, vote, view history
- **[OpenBook](https://openbook.so)**: Transparent business management (if applicable)
- **Block Explorer**: View all on-chain activity

### Create Proposals

You can propose any on-chain action:
- Transfer tokens from treasury
- Change governance parameters
- Update the Manager address
- Execute smart contract calls
- Anything the DAO's treasury can do!

## Troubleshooting

### Transaction Failed

**Insufficient Gas**
- Ensure you have enough ETH for gas fees
- Try increasing gas limit or gas price

**Network Congestion**
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Check network status on the block explorer

### Tokens Not Appearing in Wallet

**Manual Token Import**
1. Open your wallet
2. Click "Import Token" or "Add Token"
3. Select "Custom Token"
4. Paste your **Token Address**
5. Token name and symbol should auto-fill

### Can't Create Proposals

**Need 1% of Supply**
- Ensure you have at least 1% of tokens
- Check that your tokens are delegated (should be automatic)
- Try refreshing the governance interface

### Voting Power Shows Zero

**Delegation Issue**
- CreateDAO v2 has auto-delegation, but if needed:
- Call `token.delegate(yourAddress)` to activate voting power
- Voting power updates at the next block

## Security Best Practices

1. **Verify Contract Addresses**: Always check addresses on the official [Deployed Contracts](/deployed-contracts) page

2. **Test First**: Deploy on Sepolia testnet before mainnet

3. **Secure Your Wallet**: Use hardware wallets for high-value DAOs

4. **Review Proposals**: Always review proposal calldata before voting

5. **Timelock Protection**: The 1-day delay protects against harmful proposals
