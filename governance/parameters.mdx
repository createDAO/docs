## Parameters Overview

### Voting Delay

**What it is**: Time between proposal creation and the start of voting

**Default**: 1 day (86400 seconds)

**Purpose**:
- Gives community members time to review proposals
- Allows token holders to acquire tokens if they want to vote
- Prevents rushed governance attacks

**When to change**: 
- Increase for major decisions requiring careful review
- Decrease for routine or time-sensitive proposals

### Voting Period

**What it is**: Duration of the active voting window

**Default**: 1 week (604800 seconds)

**Purpose**:
- Provides sufficient time for community participation
- Balances urgency with inclusivity
- Accounts for different time zones and schedules

**When to change**:
- Increase for controversial or complex proposals
- Decrease for routine maintenance

### Quorum

**What it is**: Minimum percentage of token supply that must participate for a vote to be valid

**Default**: 1% of total supply

**Purpose**:
- Ensures minimum community engagement
- Prevents decisions made by tiny minorities
- Set at 1% to enable bootstrap governance by creator

**When to change**:
- Increase as your community grows and becomes more active
- Must be done carefully via governance proposal

### Proposal Threshold

**What it is**: Minimum tokens required to create a proposal

**Default**: 1% of total supply

**Purpose**:
- Prevents spam proposals
- Ensures proposers have meaningful stake
- Matches creator's allocation

**When to change**:
- Lower to encourage more participation
- Raise to filter for more serious proposals

### Timelock Delay

**What it is**: Time between proposal execution approval and actual execution

**Default**: 1 day (86400 seconds)

**Purpose**:
- Security mechanism to prevent malicious proposals
