Source: [`contracts/DAOTreasury.sol`](https://github.com/createdao/createdao-contracts/blob/main/contracts/DAOTreasury.sol) *(Note: Update link if necessary)*

The `DAOTreasury.sol` contract provides the implementation logic for the DAO's treasury, responsible for holding and managing the DAO's funds (native currency like ETH, and ERC20 tokens). It is used behind a `DAOTreasuryProxy`.

## Key Concepts

*   **Fund Custody:** Holds the assets belonging to the DAO.
*   **DAO Controlled:** All outgoing transfers are initiated *only* by the associated `DAO` contract through the execution of successful governance proposals (specifically `proposeTransfer` proposals). Direct transfers by external accounts are not possible.
*   **Asset Support:** Designed to hold the native blockchain currency (e.g., ETH) and any ERC20 tokens.

## Expected Functionality (Based on common patterns and DAO/Factory interactions)

*(This section is a placeholder and will be updated after analyzing `DAOTreasury.sol`)*

*   **`transferETH(address payable recipient, uint256 amount)`:** Transfers native currency from the treasury. Should only be callable by the associated `DAO` contract.
*   **`transferERC20(address token, address recipient, uint256 amount)`:** Transfers ERC20 tokens from the treasury. Should only be callable by the associated `DAO` contract.
*   **`initialize(address daoAddress)`:** An initializer function called by the proxy during deployment (specifically, called by the `DAOFactory` *after* the DAO proxy is deployed), linking the treasury to its controlling `DAO` contract address.
*   **Receive Ether:** Likely implements a `receive() external payable` or `fallback() external payable` function to allow the treasury address to receive direct deposits of native currency.
*   **ERC20 Deposits:** ERC20 tokens can be transferred directly to the Treasury contract's address using the standard `transfer` function of the respective ERC20 contract.

## Events

*(This section is a placeholder)*

*   `ETHTransfer(address indexed recipient, uint256 amount)`: Emitted when native currency is transferred out.
*   `ERC20Transfer(address indexed token, address indexed recipient, uint256 amount)`: Emitted when ERC20 tokens are transferred out.
*   `ETHReceived(address indexed sender, uint256 amount)`: Emitted when native currency is received directly.

## Upgradeability

Uses the UUPS proxy pattern. Upgrades are managed via the `DAO` contract's `proposeUpgrade` governance process.
