Source: [`contracts/DAOToken.sol`](https://github.com/createdao/createdao-contracts/blob/main/contracts/DAOToken.sol) *(Note: Update link if necessary)*

The `DAOToken.sol` contract provides the implementation logic for the DAO's governance token, typically used behind a `DAOTokenProxy`. It is expected to be an ERC20-compliant token with potential extensions for governance purposes.

## Key Concepts

*   **Governance Token:** Represents voting power and potentially other utility within the DAO ecosystem.
*   **ERC20 Standard:** Adheres to the standard interface for fungible tokens on EVM chains.
*   **Integration:** Works closely with the `DAOStaking` contract (for voting power calculation) and `DAOTreasury` (where non-circulating supply might be held).
*   **Ownership:** Typically owned by the `DAO` contract after deployment, allowing the DAO to manage aspects like minting or burning (if implemented) via governance proposals.

## Expected Functionality (Based on common patterns and Factory interactions)

*(This section is a placeholder and will be updated after analyzing `DAOToken.sol`)*

*   **Standard ERC20 Functions:** `name()`, `symbol()`, `decimals()`, `totalSupply()`, `balanceOf(address account)`, `transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)`, `allowance(address owner, address spender)`, `approve(address spender, uint256 amount)`, `transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)`.
*   **Initialization:** An `initialize` function called by the proxy during deployment via the `DAOFactory`, setting name, symbol, initial supply, and potentially initial owner/distribution.
*   **Ownership Transfer:** Likely includes `transferOwnership(address newOwner)` from OpenZeppelin's `OwnableUpgradeable`.
*   **Staking Contract Link:** May include a function like `setStakingContract(address stakingContract)` called by the `DAOFactory` or `DAO` to link the token to its corresponding staking mechanism.
*   **Whitelist/Tax Handling:** May include functions like `updateWhitelist(address[] accounts, bool isWhitelisted)` to manage addresses exempt from potential transfer taxes (if implemented).
*   **(Optional) Minting/Burning:** May include functions like `mint(address account, uint256 amount)` or `burn(uint256 amount)`, likely restricted to the owner (the DAO contract).

## Events

*(This section is a placeholder)*

*   Standard ERC20 events: `Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)`, `Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value)`.
*   Ownership events: `OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner)`.
*   Other custom events related to specific features (e.g., `StakingContractSet`, `WhitelistUpdated`).

## Upgradeability

Uses the UUPS proxy pattern. Upgrades are managed via the `DAO` contract's `proposeUpgrade` governance process.
